With the number of
potential components one wishes to adjust and the range those
components can be adjusted, it becomes unrealistic to simply perform
an exhaustive search across the entire space. Aside from taking days,
weeks, or even months of simulation time, the search will bring up
many architectural combinations that would be unrealistic for the
given set of applications. To this end, this section describes the
high level design for \blackBox{} takes in order to select a set of
heterogeneous cores that are well suited to the application space
being examined.

The second point is
self-evident; if the workloads are not representative of the total
amount of work the \Ravan{} processors are designed for, then there
may be a significant performance and/or energy cost to be paid.
