\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we have presented a model, \blackBox{}, that allows for
heterogeneous core design without the need to exhaustively search for
good cores for a given set of applications. This is done by creating a
series of performance, area, and power equations that predict the
performance of a set of potential heterogeneous cores. These are then
validated for the user via gem5 simulations and McPAT power analysis
to get more accurate values, and these results are then fed back into
the regression training set to allow \blackBox{} to continue learning
about new applications and what works for them. When such processors
are actually tested, we generally see an efficiency improvement of
between 5-10\% over a homogeneous core that was designed with
some energy savings in mind and a basic two-way heterogeneous core
that reflects current heterogeneous design approaches.
